# Fraudulent Transaction Detector

This project builds a model to predict fraudulent Ethereum transactions.

Originally intended for local bank transactions, but due to lack of access to sensitive financial data, a publicly available Ethereum dataset from Kaggle is used instead.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone <project_url>
cd <project_name>

# 2. Install dependencies using uv
uv sync

# 3. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment manually
source .venv/bin/activate        # for Unix/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate           # for Windows

uv run jupyter lab               # preferred: uses the uv-managed environment
# OR if you activated manually:
jupyter lab
```
